# Activation-functions-for-Neural-networks

In simple words, the activation function is an equation that is used to convert an input of a node in a Neural network/Layer to an output. It is a logic “gate” in between the input feeding the current neuron and its output going to the next layer(if stacked).

The main objective of the activation function is to introduce non-linearilty to neuron and determine whether to activate a neuron in a layer or not. Such that, during model building, only the activated neurons are considered.
